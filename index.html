It is an honour and privilege for me to lead this prestigious institute which has a rich history of its distinction in teaching, research and service to the nation. It is the first regional engineering college whose foundation stone has been laid by the former prime minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in the year 1959. Over a period of more than six decades, NIT Warangal has emerged as one of the leading institutions in engineering and technology. Warangal is the second largest city of the state of Telangana, Hyderabad being the first one which has several places of interest to visit.</p></div>
